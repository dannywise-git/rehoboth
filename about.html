In 1 Chronicles as God was giving the instructions for the order of the temple he assigned musicians and not just any musicians, but those from the tribe of Levi who were priestly as well as skilled and trained. 1 Chronicles 25:6-7 says, â€œAll these men were under the supervision of their father for the music of the temple of the LORD, with cymbals, lyres and harps, for the ministry at the house of God.</p>
